# GATES — evidence log

A gate passes only if every criterion is met (Roadmap v2.0 Part Q, v3 §6). Evidence is a committed file or a command that regenerates it. Criteria for a gate are committed **before** the gate is run (v3 §6.1).

Legend: ✅ passed · 🟡 passed with a documented shortfall · ⏳ pending · ⬜ not started

| Gate | Scope | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** Spec + scope frozen | D-1…D-19 | ⏳ owner sign-off pending | `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`. The tag `spec-v1` is **not** created until the owner confirms D-1…D-15 (single-owner confirmation: one dated entry in `DECISIONS.md`) |
| **1** Interface, 3 environments | Phase 2 | ✅ | `tests/contract/test_env_contract.py`; `data/manifests/MANIFEST.sha256`; `reports/env_profiles/phase2_profile.json` |
| **1B'** New environments (MATH, MBPP, too-hard) | v3 Phase E | 🟡 MATH35 and MBPP built and verified; 0.5B pass@8: gsm8k 0.69, math35 0.34, mbpp 0.50 (learnable-arm rule passes, D-86); too-hard = Countdown (0/512); cost spread 1.45x under HF timing, vLLM re-measurement pending | `reports/env_profiles/phase_e_profile.json`, `tests/contract/test_env_contract_phase_e.py`, `tests/unit/test_{math35,sandbox}.py`, D-85. Gold 100% / garbage 0% on both; sandbox timeout and reward-hack tests pass; manifests reproduce byte-identically |
| **2** Simulator recovery (Curator v0) | v2 Phases 5–6 | 🟡 | `python experiments/gate2_check.py --seeds 50` → `reports/gate2/gate2.{json,md}`. Criteria a, b, c, d, e **all pass** on evaluation seeds 100–149 (re-run after the Phase C re-tune, D-68). Dev target (oracle-gap closure ≥ 75% in S-A) is **not** met (43%); analysed in D-65 (ceiling 75.9% with a 6-round warm-up in a 25-round episode) |
| **2''** Beats SEC/DUMP-style bandits; homogeneous twin | v3 Phase C | ❌ **fails (i) on S-I** before calibration; (ii), (iii), (iv) pass | `python experiments/gate2b_check.py --seeds 50` → `reports/gate2/gate2b.{json,md}`; diagnosis in `reports/analysis/curator_diagnosis.md`, D-69. Acceptance test for Phase D: re-run with the calibrated Curator (no privileged information) and pass (i) on S-I |
| **2''-CRE** Calibrated Reward Engine, pre-registered (D-76) | v3 Phase D | ❌ **fails (i) on S-I**; (ii), (iii) pass; CRE ≈ targeted Curator | `python experiments/cre_gate.py --seeds 50 --seed0 200` → `reports/gate2/cre_gate.{json,md}`; diagnosis `reports/analysis/cre_diagnosis.md`, D-78, D-79. Engine inert in S-A/B/C by construction |
| **2''-κ** H-κ: CRE with tuned κ/τ (D-80) | v3 Phase D | ❌ primary fails (S-I −0.010 vs SEC, −0.012 vs DUMP); CRE − control +0.001; regresses S-A and S-C | `python experiments/cre_kappa_gate.py --seeds 50 --seed0 300` → `reports/gate2/cre_kappa_gate.md`, D-80…D-82 |

| **4** Curator does not alter GRPO | v1 Phase 8 | ⬜ | equivalence margins pre-registered in `EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.md` §3 |
| **5** Cost verified | v1 Phase 8 | ⬜ | — |
| **6** Calibration works | v1 Phase 9 | ❌ 6-sim not met | calibrator + targeted calibration built (D-73, D-75); `reports/analysis/calibration_power.md`: targeting detects the noisy arm in up to 87% of seeds under 10% cost but with 7.3% false flags; the rule's choice detects 33% / 10% |

Mean final scores (50 seeds):

| | Uniform | Static | LP | Std UCB | SEC-style | DUMP-style | Curator |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-A | 0.5786 | 0.6081 | 0.6096 | 0.6238 | 0.5782 | 0.5715 | **0.6404** |
| S-B | 0.4052 | 0.4178 | 0.4174 | 0.4210 | 0.4130 | 0.4129 | 0.4162 |
| S-C | 0.3416 | 0.3436 | 0.3464 | 0.3591 | 0.3420 | 0.3442 | **0.4031** |
| S-I | 0.3561 | 0.3516 | 0.3691 | **0.3720** | 0.3646 | 0.3640 | 0.3562 |
| S-J | 0.3552 | 0.3459 | 0.3716 | **0.3838** | 0.3673 | 0.3669 | 0.3651 |

Read with care:
- Curator's advantage is large where cost varies independently of value (S-C) and absent where the valuable arms are the expensive ones (S-I). The noisy arm absorbs 20–25% of Curator's compute before calibration; a privileged (perfect) S5 flag lifts Curator in S-I to +0.030–0.036 over Uniform on tuning seeds, i.e. to the level of the SEC/DUMP-style baselines (+0.020–0.031) but still below Standard UCB (+0.053) (`reports/analysis/curator_diagnosis.md`). That is an upper bound, not a result: the S-I criterion stays failed until Phase D passes it without privileged information.
- Standard UCB (cost-blind, no statuses) is the strongest baseline in S-I and S-J, which is why the paper's cost-aware claim must be carried by the real cost-heterogeneous portfolio and by calibration.
- Allocation is near one-hot for UCB and Curator in S-A and S-C (mean max-weight 0.84–0.89); SEC/DUMP-style stay close to uniform (0.17–0.47). See D-67.

"""Environment abstraction (Roadmap D.1, frozen interface).

An Environment turns data (or a generator) into `Prompt`s and turns
(model, prompt, response) triples into verified rewards. It never computes
learning progress and never reads a clock except its own verifier timing.

Ownership summary (Roadmap D.1):
- success / reward / verifier time / parse failure  -> Environment (Verdict)
- prompt tokens, completion tokens, rollout count    -> trainer adapter
- GPU-seconds / dollars                              -> Cost Meter (Part H)
- pass rate, LP, richness, status, proxy reward      -> Signal Engine
- weights, UCB scores                                -> Scheduler

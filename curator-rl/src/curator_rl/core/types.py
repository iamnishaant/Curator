"""Core data contracts (Roadmap B.3, frozen in Phase 2).

These types are owned by `core` (L0) so every layer (scheduler, simulator,
trainer adapter) can share them: the simulator, the trace replayer and the
real trainer all produce the same observation types.

Phase 2 introduces `Prompt`, `Verdict`, `RolloutGroup` and `CostPrior`.
Phase 3 adds `EnvRoundObs`, `RoundObservation` and `CalibrationObservation`
(Roadmap B.3): the simulator, the trace replayer and the real trainer all
produce these same observation types. Phase 4 adds `EnvStatus` and
`SignalVector` (the Signal Engine's per-environment output). `MixtureDecision`
and `RoiRecord` are added in the phases that first need them (Roadmap Part
P, decision D-26).
